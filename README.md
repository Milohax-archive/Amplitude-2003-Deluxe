# Amplitude-2003-Deluxe
QoL enhancements and additions to Amplitude (2003)

# Setup
NOTE: You WILL need a modded/hacked console to play this mod on console. I hope this is clear

Actions:  
Once I get it working, prebuilt .ark files will be available in the [Actions](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/amplitude_2003_deluxe/actions) tab of this repo.

# Install
To install Amplitude Deluxe, you must inject the built .ark into your .iso backup of the game with a tool such as Apache.
